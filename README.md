Github is a great way for me to showcase my work to the world, and to allow others to contribute to my work as well. The world, especially in tech, is moving towards emphasizing people’s skills and their abilities over academic credentials when it comes to recruiting, so it’s a great way for me to showcase my real-world coding experience
